## Hello

This repository stores all the C# Projects from my 2 Year BTEC Computing course at college. 
None of this is perfect so there will be bugs, this is just projects that I've worked on. Some may include some psuedocode as well if you would like to see how the program works. 

<!-- Explanation of Everything -->
## How It Works

- Each folder is a seperate program
- There is a folder called `1. Exe Files` which includes .exe's for every program if you don't want to search the code and just want to see it in action. 
- Below is a little explanation of each program and kind of what it does. 
- In the future, each folder will have a ReadMe file which will include more detail about it and a direct download link to the `.exe` for anyone who wants to test it.

## Breakdown

### Exe Files
In here, you can find all the downloadable `.exe` files for every project folder, to save you from navigating the project folders for them. If you would like to find them in a folder, they'd typically be under `/bin/debug/` and then the `.exe` that is in there. 
 
### Calculator
This is just a basic ass calculator that was one of the first C# Projects I did. <br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/Calculator.exe)**

### Demonstration
Literally, the first project created and was used to follow along with the lecturer's instructions. Nothing big to be honest.<br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/Demonstration.exe)**

### Green Bottles
Green Bottles song generator. Takes the number of green bottles and makes it into a song utilising a for loop.
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/GreenBottles.exe)**
 
### Number to Words
Converts a number to words.<br>
E.g - 69 = Sixty-nine<br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/NumberToWords.exe)**

### Password
Most basic login page. All data is hardcoded. <br>
Username: Rick <br>
Password: Astley <br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/Password.exe)**

### Playground Area
Just a place for me to mess around, doesn't have an .exe either.

### Roman Numeral Converter
Converts a number to roman numerals. <br>
E.g - 69 = LXIX <br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/Roman%20Numeral%20Converter.exe)**

### Year of Birth
Finds your year of birth from your age and whether you've had a birthday yet or not. <br>
**[Exe File](https://github.com/bwhybrow23/cs-projects/raw/main/1.%20EXE%20Files/YearOfBirth.exe)**
